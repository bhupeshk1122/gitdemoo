<p>One issue I encountered while setting up my folder structure and linking to files was incorrectly using the public_html directory in my paths. Initially, I mistakenly included public_html in the path when trying to link to the COMP1234 directory. Because of this, the browser couldn’t locate the correct folder, leading to a 404 error. After researching and troubleshooting, I realized that public_html serves as the root directory for the web server, meaning it doesn’t need to be explicitly mentioned in URLs. This misunderstanding caused the linking issues I faced.</p>

<p> I mistakenly included public_html in my directory path, which led to a 404 error because the browser couldn't find the URL. To fix this, I first reviewed my folder structure and checked the URLs I was using to ensure they were correct before moving on to debugging. I experimented with different ways to reference the COMP1234 directory, testing both relative and root-relative links. After trying several approaches and verifying if the browser could locate the directory, I discovered that public_html was already set as the server’s root directory. This meant I didn’t need to include it in the path. Once I removed it, everything worked immediately.</p>

<p>I've got to know how important the relationship is in web development projects between HTML and file structure. After debugging and solving url errors, I've learned that the website cannot function properly until the directory link is in the correct place. If the paths to files and directories are incorrect, the browser won't be able to locate the resources, leading to broken links or missing content.</p>

<p>The most challenging part of the assignment for me was correctly linking the directories. Initially, I made the mistake of including public_html in the path, which caused 404 errors since it is already the root directory on the server. As a result, I encountered broken links and had difficulty identifying the issue. To troubleshoot, I experimented with both absolute and relative paths to fix the broken links. After several attempts, I finally realized that public_html didn’t need to be included in the link. Once I removed it and tested the updated paths, everything worked perfectly. This experience not only helped me successfully link the directories but also improved my understanding of file paths throughout the assignment.</p>
